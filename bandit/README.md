This project was started to help with the idea of hands off action and result

## Project 

The script automates the process to collect the password for the next level


## Usage

Please read the code before running this script so you can have an understanding of what changes you will have to make are. The only python module that needs import at this moment in time is "paramiko"

```
pip install paramiko
```

## Contributing

Pull requests are welcome. For major changes, please open an issue first
to discuss what you would like to change. I am more than happy to receive feedback for any major script errors please let me know.

Please make sure to update tests as appropriate.
